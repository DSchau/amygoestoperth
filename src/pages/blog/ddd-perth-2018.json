      "content": "This weekend I got the chance to go to my second DDD conference in Perth, and experience a little of the behind-the-scenes action working on one of the sponsor booths. Having been to my first DDD last year, they'd set the bar pretty high and still managed to not only do better, but smash it out of the park. The team outdid themselves again with more than 50% more attendees than last year (where they'd doubled the year before) and put together an even bigger line-up of talent after receiving over 200 proposal submissions (pretty sure that's an international record ðŸŽ‰)."
